## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- **Mobile First Approach**
  In this project, I adopted the mobile-first approach to explore its effectiveness. I found it quite beneficial and will likely utilize this method in future challenges.

- **Classes and Presets Naming Convention**  
  I worked on enhancing the naming convention for classes and presets. With continued practice, I hope to refine this skill further.

- **HTML Landmark roles**
  To gain a deeper understanding of HTML landmark roles and their impact on accessibility, I implemented them as part of this challenge.
